- **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)** - Efficient state management with minimal boilerplate
- **[React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/)** - Declarative client-side routing with data loading

**Build Tools & Performance**

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** - Lightning-fast build tool with native ESM support
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** - Code quality and consistency enforcement
- **[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)** - CSS processing with autoprefixing

// components/MyComponent/MyComponent.jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic here

  return <div className="my-component">{/* Component JSX */}</div>;
};

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  prop1: PropTypes.string.required,
  prop2: PropTypes.number,
};

export default MyComponent;
```
